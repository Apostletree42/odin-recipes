            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Basmati Rice</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Yogurt</li>
            <li>Ginger-Garlic Paste</li>
            <li>Biryani Masala</li>
            <li>Cooking Oil or Ghee</li>

            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
    
        <h2>Step 1: Marinating the Chicken</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean and cut the chicken into pieces.</li>
            <li>Mix the chicken pieces with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, biryani masala, green chilies, chopped mint, chopped
                cilantro, lemon juice, and salt.</li>
            <li>Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes to 2 hours (longer marination enhances the flavor).</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Step 2: Preparing the Rice</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and soak the basmati rice in water for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and whole spices (like cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves) to
                the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water.</li>
            <li>Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked (it should still have a slight bite). Drain the rice and set
                aside.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Step 3: Cooking the Chicken</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat oil or ghee.</li>
            <li>Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown and crispy. Remove a portion for garnish.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes to the remaining onions in the pan. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil
                starts to separate.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated chicken to the pan. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink and is partially cooked.</li>
            <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken in the pan.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle fried onions, chopped mint, and chopped cilantro over the rice layer.</li>
            <li>Dissolve saffron in warm milk and drizzle it over the rice. You can also add a few drops of food coloring at
                this stage (optional).</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid. Seal the edges with dough or a cloth.</li>
            <li>Cook on low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the chicken to
                cook completely.</li>
            <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork to mix the layers before serving.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2>Step 4: Serving</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Serve hot chicken biryani with raita (yogurt sauce) and/or salad.</li>
            <li>Garnish with additional fried onions, chopped cilantro, and mint leaves.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken biryani!</li>
        </ol>
